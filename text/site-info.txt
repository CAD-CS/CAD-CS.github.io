This site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It did not start that way. I originally built it with Next.js, which fit my background but felt a little too familiar. I wanted a challenge, so I moved to a lighter stack with Alpine, Tailwind, and Web Components. After some experimenting, I decided to go all in on fundamentals and rebuilt everything with vanilla JS and CSS.

It turned out to be a great decision. I deepened my understanding of the DOM, sharpened my core web development skills, and got plenty of hands‑on experience with Web Components. It was a lot of fun, and who knows, maybe Web Components really are the future of the web ;)
