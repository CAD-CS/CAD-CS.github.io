I am a software developer and IT support analyst who thrives on solving problems, learning quickly, and delivering meaningful results. I bring a strong foundation in software development, systems troubleshooting, and clear technical communication, with experience supporting diverse users and adapting to fast‑changing environments.

In my development work, I’ve built projects ranging from web applications to data‑driven tools, focusing on clean design, reliability, and user experience. In IT support, I provide confidential technical assistance to university faculty, translating complex issues into clear solutions, documenting processes, and handling sensitive information with professionalism and discretion.
My strongest qualities are collaboration, client communication, and conflict resolution. I enjoy mentoring new team members, contributing to positive team culture, and ensuring projects move forward smoothly.

Community involvement is also important to me. I regularly volunteer at events such as ProtoCON, supporting designers and playtesters, and the Powell Street Festival, one of Vancouver’s largest cultural celebrations. Giving back keeps me grounded and connected.
