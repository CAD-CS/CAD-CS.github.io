I’m a software developer and IT support analyst with a strong foundation in development, systems troubleshooting, and clear technical communication. I’m quick to learn, effective under pressure, and focused on delivering meaningful results.

My development work spans web applications and data‑driven tools, with an emphasis on clean design, reliability, and user experience. In IT support, I provide confidential technical assistance to university faculty, translating complex issues into clear solutions, documenting processes, and handling sensitive information with professionalism.

I excel at collaboration, client communication, and conflict resolution. I enjoy mentoring new team members, supporting positive team culture, and helping projects move forward smoothly.

Community involvement matters to me as well. I volunteer at events like ProtoCON and the Powell Street Festival, supporting creative communities and staying connected through service.
