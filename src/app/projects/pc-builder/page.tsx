        For our database management system, we used PostgreSQL while we used NodeJS and ExpressJS for our backend and React for our frontend.

        <ContentHeader>Project Overview</ContentHeader>
        <ContentParagraph>
        Made in a team of three people, this project is a web app to store information on different pc builds, and provide a platform for reviewing and testing them. There are multiple components, and each component can be in different builds. Users are able to post reviews of different builds, as well, benchmark tests can be posted for different builds. This will allow users to gather enough information to be well informed when making their PCâ€™s.

        <ContentParagraph>
          This project was a great opporunity to learn about databases and database management tools such as PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. I particularly enjoyed playing around with the psql (SQL shell) command line tool. Additionally, learning about functional dependencies and how to properly normalize a database was a great experience.
